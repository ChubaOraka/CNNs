# Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

This is a collection of Lecture Materials from a series of lectures given by [Ali Talib](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aliasgertalib) at [MoCoMakers events](https://www.meetup.com/MoCoMakers).
The lectures were hosted by [Montgomery County Makers (MoCo Makers)](http://www.mocomakers.com/) based in the [Rockville Memorial Library](https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=Rockville+Town+Square+Plaza%2C+30+Maryland+Ave%2C+Rockville%2C+MD%2C+us).


## About the lectures
- [Lecture 1](https://www.meetup.com/MoCoMakers/events/mdxsppyxhbrb/): The first lecture gave us an introduction into the concept of neural networks.
- [Lecture 2](https://www.meetup.com/MoCoMakers/events/mdxsppyxhbkc/): We had deep dive into the code for shallow and deep networks, comparing the accuracy of the two.
- [Lecture 3](https://www.meetup.com/MoCoMakers/events/mdxsppyxjbnb/): This lecture introduced us to Adversarial attacks that can be done against neural networks. We were also introduced to the principles behind Generative Adversarial Networks.
- [Lecture 4](https://www.meetup.com/MoCoMakers/events/mdxsppyxkblb/): This lecture goes into more details Adversarial attacks and defense against them. We also discussed Generative Adversarial Networks.
- [Lecture 5](https://www.meetup.com/MoCoMakers/events/mdxsppyxlbzb/): The fifth lecture had practical demonstration of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Some of the applications that were illustrated include the following:
    - [Celebrity Faces](./Lecture%205/CelebrityFaces-GAN): New faces are generated after training with pictures of celebrity faces. 
    - [MNIST](./Lecture%205/MNIST-GAN): New fonts are generated by a GAN. 

    I would like to highlight this repo from [Ali Talib's GitHub page](https://github.com/AliAsgerTalib-AI):
    >   [All-About-the-GAN](https://github.com/AliAsgerTalib-AI/All-About-the-GAN) repo gives some introduction to GANs
- [Lecture 6](https://www.meetup.com/MoCoMakers/events/mdxsppyxmbvb/): We were introduced to a new tool that adopted a more graphical, drag-and-drop approach to creating machine learning model called by [Deep Learning Studio](https://app.deepcognition.ai/app/project/1/data) by [Deep Cognition](https://deepcognition.ai/). **[This folder is empty at the momemt]**
