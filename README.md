# Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

This is a collection of Lecture Materials from a series of lectures given by [Ali Talib](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aliasgertalib) at [MoCoMakers events](https://www.meetup.com/MoCoMakers).
The lectures were hosted by [Montgomery County Makers (MoCo Makers)](http://www.mocomakers.com/) based in the [Rockville Memorial Library](https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=Rockville+Town+Square+Plaza%2C+30+Maryland+Ave%2C+Rockville%2C+MD%2C+us).


## About the lectures
- [Lecture 1](https://www.meetup.com/MoCoMakers/events/mdxsppyxhbrb/): The first lecture gave us an introduction into the concept of neural networks.
- [Lecture 2](https://www.meetup.com/MoCoMakers/events/mdxsppyxhbkc/): We had deep dive into the code for shallow and deep networks, comparing the accuracy of the two.
- [Lecture 3](https://www.meetup.com/MoCoMakers/events/mdxsppyxjbnb/): This lecture introduced us to Adversarial attacks that can be done against neural networks. We were also introduced to the principles behind Generative Adversarial Networks.
- [Lecture 4](https://www.meetup.com/MoCoMakers/events/mdxsppyxkblb/): This lecture goes into more details Adversarial attacks and defense against them. We also discussed Generative Adversarial Networks.
